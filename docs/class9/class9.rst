This lab will show how to enable single sign-on (SSO) for applications being proxied by 
NGINX Plus. The solution uses OpenID Connect as the authentication mechanism, with 
Keycloak as the identity provider (IdP), and NGINX Plus as the relying party. 
The lab will also cover the creation of an Instance Group of NGINX Plus servers using NGINX Instance Manager, which will be load balanced using F5 BIG-IP DNS (GSLB).

Expected time to complete: **1.5 hours**
